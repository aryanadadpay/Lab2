        "Diverging bar charts are simple standard bar charts that can handle both negative and positive magnitude values.  This chart effectively emphasizes variation in data values by using a fixed point. One thing to note about this chart is that the marks which go left or right does not necessarily reflect positive or negative, and the divergent line can represent a magnitude of values. It could be numerical, a goal, yes or no’s, time periods, or any different type of survey data. A really good type of data that can be represented by this type of graph is negative and positive  values that are compared at the baseline."

This graph shows the relationship between multiple different points over the graphs x and y axis. The values of the two variables show a pattern through the different scattered points throughout the plot, which can lead to show if there is any correlation in the data set. The correlation types that can be shown are positive, negative, or null depending on the slope of the pattern of dats that are scattered. You can draw or  insert a line of best fit (trendline) throughout all of the points to indicate the slope of the points and thus help determine the relationship (if there is one) of the graphs points.\n"

It is very effective at showing the different values in a dataset as well as their frequency, and the different “skews” of the data and the overall shape of the graph is effective at highlighting patterns. Histograms use their different bar heights to group different numbers and values in the data set into different ranges. The taller bars represent that that value has more data in it than the shorter bars. You can look at the distribution and spread of the data to see if it it skewed more towards the right, left, or concentrated in the middle.\n"

If the data is irregular, markers are a good idea to represent the data points and differentiate them. Change over time is really well shown throughout line graphs because they can track changes over both short and long periods of time. Due to the nature of the dataset I used having relatively smaller changes, this instance better calls for a line graph as opposed to a bar graph. If necessary, you can also add multiple lines to compare different data sets on the same graph and you can manage it well so it is not over crowded. \n"

The graph divides the top ten types of mascots into sectors to show the viewers the part amount (out of the whole) graph that each madcot represents. These proportions are really useful for us, as the different segments all mke up the larger whole \"pie.\"  One downside to this graph is that it can be difficult at times to accurately compare the sizes of the segments to the whole graph. This graph enables you to focus on the top ten mascots, as opposed to all of them and it shows how influencial each individual one was, which is not something most bar charts are able to portray."
